    "* An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values. It iterates over iterable objects such as list, tuple, sets etc. By using class, the iterators are implemented. It follows lazy evaluation. In this case, the evaluation of the expression will be on hold and stored in the memory until the item is called specifically which helps us to avoid repeated evaluation. Hence, it requires only 1 memory location to process the value. Here, the iter() keyword is used to create an iterator containing an iterable object. and next() keyword is used to call the next element in the iterable object.\n",

    "* The generators are nothing nut the another way of creating iterators by using the keyword yield instead of return i a function defined as Generators are implemented using functions. Similar to the iterators, the generators also follows lazy evaluation. Here, the yield function returns the result without affecting the function. Instead this will return a  sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the dataas they won't store the entire sequence in the memory."
